How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

This APP allows the user to to purchase a snack. The user preses a button that activates a click function that updates my database with the remaining number of items left for that snack. After you click which item you want then you press play that activates another click function that tells the user the new total of money raised for our cause. When the user presses either login or sinup they are taken to another view to either login or sign up. Once a user signs up and logins in they can adjust the amount of items per each snack so that they do not run out.

Optimizations
If I had time to come back to this app and work on it some more I want to make it so that whenever the item is 0 in the database that it will aleart the admin and user that there are no more items left and needs to be replemished. Also I want to make this app usable for users who just want to make money and not donate to a cause.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to pin-point elements in the DOM more accuratly. I also Learned how to manipulate and update the information in my database using my own server.
